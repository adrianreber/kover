<sect>Introduction
<p>

I started development of Kover because my friend and I sometimes start
Windoze... to print covers for our burned CDs. That was very easy with
EasyCD Pro 2.0. But I wanted a program for KDE. And it should not be only as
good as EasyCD Pro, it should be better...

<sect1>Changes
<p>

See ChangeLog for this information.

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain Kover 
<p>

You can get it from <htmlurl url="http://www.fischlustig.de/kover" name = "http://www.fischlustig.de/kover">
<p>
There is always the newest version, the changes, and some additional information.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>

As you might expect you need KDE, KDE 1.0 should be enough, I use KDE 1.1

You need QT, I use 1.42, I didn't test it with QT 1.40

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Kover on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Kover distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since Kover uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<htmlurl url="mailto:dok@fischlustig.de" name = "Denis Oliver Kropp <dok@fischlustig.de">

<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> General Usage

The general usage is

<verb>
- start it (very important)
- type in title, contents
- select fonts/colors for title and contents
- select background color and/or background image
- print it, cut it, fold it, ...
</verb>

<sect1> CDDB Usage
<p>

Kover has the feature to look at the CDDB for your CD Audio!
Just click on the CDDB icon after inserting your audio CD into /dev/cdrom.
Kover will connect to CDDB, queries the server, and fills in title/artist
and all tracks, it also generates the track numbers in front of them.
