- moc files now as include in the C++ file:

Header files declaring a QObject descendant have to be run through moc to
produce a .moc file.  This .moc file has to be compiled, for which two
possibilities exists: compile it separately, or #include it in the C++ file
implementing that above mentioned class.  The latter is more efficient in term
of compilation speed.

- some typos fixed. --enable-final should work now
- included a mime-type application/x-kover
- now using the KURL object to open and save files.
  it is now possible to save and open files via ftp...
