Kover TODO
===========

General:

-more error handling (especially file I/O)
-the UI layout is not the best
-po files
-Documentation
-handle toolbar movements
-transparency bugs


For 0.50:

-integrate CDDB classes from kscd and read local CDDB entries
-handle CDDB error 211, inexact match
-free positionable images


Other suggestions that arrived me, i´ll think about them:

-print booklet/inlet on one page (will cut off an inner edge of the booklet)
-directory tree as contents (could produce many booklet pages -> how to handle?)
