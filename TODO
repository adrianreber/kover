Kover TODO
===========

- icons for text and contents are for font selection and color selection
  still the same... bad.

- seperate spine text

- internationalize about kover

- save fonts/color

- directory tree as contents (ala cdrLabel)

- use kscd cddb files

General:

-more error handling (especially file I/O)
-the UI layout is not the best
-Documentation
-handle toolbar movements
-transparency bugs
-free positionable images


Other suggestions that arrived me, i'll think about them:

-print booklet/inlet on one page (will cut off an inner edge of the booklet)
-directory tree as contents (could produce many booklet pages -> how to handle?)
